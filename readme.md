# Getting Started with Frontegg CLI openid-connect-client sample

This sample is a Frontegg CLI openid-connect-client.
The idea is to demonstrate how CLI should act with oidc client using the hosted login box by Frontegg.

## Running the sample

After cloning the project, install it using

### `npm i -g`

In order to see the login CLI in action, run the following command:
### `cli-sample login`

The application will navigate to the login box and will listen for the callback.
